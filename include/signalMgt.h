Butenhof's book Programming with POSIX Threads, published by Addison Wesley. It says "Always use sigwait to work with asynchronous signals within threaded programs."</li>
 * <li>Christophe Blaess's "Programmation syst√®me en C sous Linux" (in French), published by Eyrolles also recommends sigwait (see end of chapter 12).</li>
